    <p>Adopting is a great way to give a dog or cat a second chance by providing a loving fur-ever home. All animals in our center come with a fully disclosed medical history, and are ready to join your family. They are vaccinated, microchipped, spayed/neutered, and have had preventative parasite treatments.</p>
    <h1 class="font-bold text-center mt-4">Love pets but cannot commit forever?</h1>
    <p> If you would like to care for an animal but you’re not in a position to adopt one, then fostering is ideal for you! By opening your home to foster an animal, you will make space at our center for other animals that need us. Some animals need a foster home for just a few weeks, some are looking for a more permanent solution (up to a year).</p>
    <h1 class="font-bold text-center mt-4">Are you unsure about which animal to adopt? Read up here on our “foster-to-adopt” options.</h1>
    <p>We often have more animals available than listed on our website, so don’t worry if you don’t immediately find a match here. When you visit our shelter, our staff will introduce you to the animals and you will have time to get to know them. We will also ask you to join an adoption interview during which you ask any questions you may have.</p>
    <p class="mb-5">To find the perfect animal for you, please complete this questionnaire, and our Adoption & Foster Coordinator will get back to you shortly!</p>
